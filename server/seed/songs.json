    "lyrics":"I got ninety nine problems and they all bitches Wish I was Jigga man, carefree living But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louie I'm the Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys You know how I be when you start livin' large I control my own life, Charles was never in charge No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram' Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh? She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself, why he by himself? He got two older brothers, one hood, one good An independent older sister got me fly when she could But they all didn't see, The little bit of sadness in me, Scotty I've got some issues that nobody can see And all of these emotions are pouring out of me I bring them to the light for you It's only right This is the soundtrack to my life (yeah, yeah) The soundtrack to my life I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense Since my father died, I ain't been right since And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe Split an eighth of 'shrooms just so I could see the universe I tried to think about myself as a sacrifice Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night The moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom Once upon a time nobody gave a fuck It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancun Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon So it's more than right, I try to shed some light on a man Not many people of this planet understand, fam' I've got some issues that nobody can see And all of these emotions are pouring out of me I bring them to the light for you It's only right This is the soundtrack to my life The soundtrack to my life I was close to go and trying some coke And a happy ending would be slitting my throat Ignorance the cope man Ignorance is bliss Ignorance is love, and I need that shit If I never did shows, then I'd probably be a myth If I cared about the blogs, then I'd probably be a jack-ass Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout fam Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck Hope I really get to see thirty Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty Most of the clean faces be the most dirty I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry Ass all chunky, brain is insanity Only things that calm me down, pussy and some Cali tree And I get both, never truly satisfied I am happy, that's just the saddest lie I've got some issues that nobody can see And all of these emotions are pouring out of me I bring them to the light for you It's only right This is the soundtrack to my life, The soundtrack to my life To my life To my life To my life To my life Yeah uh huh yeah (to my life) Yeah uh huh yeah (to my life) Yeah uh huh yeah (to my life) Yeah uh huh yeah Yeah uh huh yeah Yeah uh huh yeah Yeah yeah"

    "lyrics":"Ooh it's dark outside I’ve been trying to get a ride While my body waits, my body waits America warm my face I've been trying to turn the page Once I was a little boy, staring at my shoes You came along and found me in the chicken coop But time takes over, I can't say when Time takes over, may we do it again Take me to the beachhead let’s go over All of those rocks at the end of the road and Take me down to main street with no clothes on  With our bare feet on the painted yellow lines With our shadows far behind us Broke into that summer school and fooled around on the infirmary cot And we can be like all those fairies Making their rain angels in the eddies And I have no expectation, just an adolescent heart Ooh it's dark outside I’ve been trying to get a ride While my body waits, my body waits America warm my face I've been trying to turn the page Once I was a little boy, staring at my shoes You came along and found me in the chicken coop But time takes over, I can't say when Time takes over, may we do it again Take me to the beachhead let’s go over All of those rocks at the end of the road Help me down the seawall let's find Marci See if she got that invitation to the movie The one where the kids break out of juvie And then by their own admission They go and turn themselves all in Just as they get there to the station The young one wheels and begs the pavement For brother speed to make arrangements with the spirits of the night Take me to the race track let's go bet on Aw the one that no one expects to win and Let's bet on the skinny horse He will surely try the hardest to come in first I bet you for the winner they put on some kind of fancy dinner Let’s be like those Philadelphia sisters That have prayed straight for a hundred years And I have no expectation, just to be here in the present And behold you for a second before it all goes away Hah ah ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah Before it all goes away Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah Ohh in those painted yellow lines With our shadows far behind Broke into that summer school and fooled around on the infirmary cot We can be like all those fairies Making their rain angels in the eddies And I have no expectation, just an adolescent heart"
